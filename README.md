As a chemists, sometimes we want to know the exact pH of the solution. Because some of the chemical reactions and extraction processes require an specific pH to get the desired product.
Using pH paper to measure the pH of the solution won't give an accurate pH because some solutions have color on their own, which interferes with measuring pH.
So would it be better if we had a better option for measuring the pH of the solution in an easy, cheap, and accurate way? With these problem I decide to build a DIY pH meter for 
use in the laboratory. This project is for educational purposes, so feel free to modify or apply anything as you like. ／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼

list of the component 
1. Arduino UNO (Or any microcontroller you like)
2. OLED 128x32 i2c (Or other type of screen)
3. jumper wire
4. diymore PH-4502C
5. BNC pH meter probe E-201C
6. Enclosure for hold every component togather
